# MicroMoth for Lua

This version of MicroMoth is compatible with Lua 5.x and PICO-8 Lua.

### Installation

Dowloading a single file is all that is needed, so the word 'installation' is perhaps overkill. All you need to do is take the [MicroMoth.lua](MicroMoth.lua) file, and place somewhere that it can be found when importing.

If using the PICO-8, you will also need the contents of [math.p8](math.p8). This provides a minimal math table required by MicroMoth.

An example of MicroMoth Lua in use can be seen in [main.lua](main.lua).

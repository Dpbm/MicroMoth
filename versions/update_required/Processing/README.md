# MicroQiskit for Processing

This version of MicroQiskit is compatible with the Processing programming language.

### Installation

Downloading a single file is all that is needed, so the word 'installation' is perhaps overkill. All you need to do is take the [microqiskit.pde](microqiskit.pde) file, and place somewhere that it can be found by Processing when importing. The easiest option is simply to put it in the same folder as any Processing scripts that will use it.

### Examples

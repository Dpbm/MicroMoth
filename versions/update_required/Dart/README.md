# MicroQiskit for Dart

This version of MicroQiskit is compatible with the Dart programming language.

### Installation

Downloading two files is all that is needed, so the word 'installation' is perhaps overkill. All you need to do is take the `lib/quantum_circuit.dart` and `lib/simulator.dart` files, and place them in your Dart application's `lib` folder. There is an example of using them in `bin/main.dart` .

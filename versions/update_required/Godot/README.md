# MicroQiskit for Godot (GDScript)

This version of MicroQiskit is compatible with the Godot Game engine (Godot scenes written for Godot 3.x.x and scripts in GDScripts) 

### Installation

Downloading a single folder is all that is needed, so the word 'installation' is perhaps overkill. All you need to do is take the [microqiskit.zip](./microqiskit.zip), unzip it and place it in the root of your Godot game project. Click on each script and scene from inside Godot editor to ensure your `project.godot` has been updated. For more detailed information, refer [here](./dev-guide.md).

### Examples

There is also a sample godot project in the [example](./example) directory.
Try it out [here](https://bhcs.itch.io/sample-quantum-godot-game) on your browser.

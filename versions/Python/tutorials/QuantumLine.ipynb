    "In this list, two neighbouring entries correspond to two neighbouring points. So we would expect that neighbouring entries will probably be somewhat similar. And if we change the list in some way, it would be good to maintain the similarity between neighbouring points.\n",

    "Another example could be the volume of a piece of music over time, perhaps expressed as a list of the volumes for each beat. Or it could be a list of brightnesses for a line of pixels. We'll stick with the height example for now, but everything that follows is valid for any other example as well.\n",

    "What we are going to to is take a list of numbers and encode it in a quantum state. We'll then manipulate the state in order to make fun things happen.\n",

    "A quantum state is essentially described by a list of bit strings which each have a corresponding number. The bit strings are the possible outputs that you could get when measuring the state. The corresponding numbers are known as the amplitudes, and can be used to calculate the probabilities for the bit strings. Here we will ignore any other information encoded in these amplitudes, and just focus on the probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our encoding of a list into a quantum state will then be as follows:\n",
    "* We assign a bit string to each position in our list;\n",

    "\n",
    "This will be most relevant when manipulating the state. We will mostly be using single qubit or controlled two qubit operations for these manipulations. The effect of these on simple bit strings is that they can only change a single bit value. For example, they can turn a `0000` into `0100` or `0001`, or turn `0110` into `1110`, and so on. Given this behaviour, we can think of bit strings as being neighbours if they differ on only one bit. And then we can make sure to assign neighbouring bit strings to neighbouring positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by the following function. It creates a list of bit strings of a given length. The number of bits is determined by the length of the list, to ensure that bit string is used only once. The list is ordered such that neighbouring entries always differ on only a single bit."
